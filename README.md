This brick downloads `pdb.gz` files from RCSB PDB. To use files for docking, you must first ungzip the desired protein files.

The list of PDB IDs is in `src/pdb_ids.txt`. They can be viewed in the [CSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/search?request=%7B%22query%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22nodes%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22nodes%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22nodes%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22terminal%22%2C%22service%22%3A%22text%22%2C%22parameters%22%3A%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22rcsb_entity_source_organism.taxonomy_lineage.id%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22exact_match%22%2C%22value%22%3A%229606%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22logical_operator%22%3A%22and%22%7D%5D%2C%22logical_operator%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22text%22%7D%5D%2C%22logical_operator%22%3A%22and%22%7D%2C%22return_type%22%3A%22polymer_entity%22%2C%22request_options%22%3A%7B%22results_content_type%22%3A%5B%22experimental%22%5D%2C%22sort%22%3A%5B%7B%22sort_by%22%3A%22score%22%2C%22direction%22%3A%22desc%22%7D%5D%2C%22scoring_strategy%22%3A%22combined%22%2C%22paginate%22%3A%7B%22start%22%3A0%2C%22rows%22%3A25%7D%7D%2C%22request_info%22%3A%7B%22query_id%22%3A%22752ba6c3abbb41bec26fab65e4ad6061%22%7D%7D) website (link for specific query).
